Welcome to the ultimate F1 Quiz Game.

Weâ€™re aiming for the following goals for this project:

1. Create a working Game: The main task is to create a Game not only will this test your understanding of TypeScript but how you
   break down a problem.

2. Practice using Git and GitHub flow: We want you to get as much practice as possible using git, GitHub and the command line.

3. Get a better understanding of how to scope a larger project: We want to see a clear plan of what you're going to build and
   how.

4. Apply what you are learning: This is a great place to apply what you have been learning on all of the course so far. When you
   get it functioning really push on the UI, use SCSS, BEM, anything else you find on the web....really go mad!

The idea that I went ahead with is for a F1 quiz game:

- There are 20 questions in the quiz, they will be randomized when playing the game.
- The scores will be represented as your position on the grid. Starting from the very back at P20 - you have to make your way up to P1!
- There will be different backgrounds and different stylings for different screen sizes. (Mainly sticking with iPhone and laptop)
- The game will also feature a restart button that will allow you to restart the whole game if you decide to do so.

UPCOMING UPDATED:
In the updates we will be aiming to:

- Add up to 50 questions for them to be randomized and really optimize the quiz experience.
- Add comments for getting the right answers or wrong answers.
- Add relevant images in the quiz container in accordance with the question.
- Add a special feature including a track and a car to really make the laptop version stand out!
